[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/lildude/phpSmug/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/lildude/phpSmug?branch=master) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lildude/phpSmug.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/lildude/phpSmug)

A simple object orientated wrapper for the new SmugMug API v2, written in PHP.

The intention of this class is to allow PHP application developers quick and easy interaction with the SmugMug API, without having to worry about the finer details of the API.

**Note: Due to significant changes in the SmugMug API, phpSmug 4.0.0 and later is not backwardly compatible with the SmugMug API v1.x.x releases.**

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.5.0,
* [Guzzle 6](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) library and the [Guzzle OAuth1 Subscriber](https://github.com/guzzle/oauth-subscriber),
* (optional) [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) and [php-cs-fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) to run tests.

## Installation

The recommended method of installing phpSmug is using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) by adding the following to your project's `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "guzzlehttp/oauth-subscriber": "0.3.*"
    }
}
```

If you don't have Composer installed, you can download it using:

```bash
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

.. and then use it to install phpSmug and all dependencies using:

```bash
$ php composer.phar install
```

If you have Composer installed, you can install phpSmug run the following from within your project directory:

```bash
$ composer install
```

## Basic Usage of the phpSmug Client

`phpSmug` follows the PSR-1, PSR-2 and PSR-4 conventions, which means you can easily use Composer's [autoloading](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading) to integrate `phpSmug` into your projects.

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Optional, but definitely nice to have, options
$options = [
    'AppName'   => 'My Cool App/1.0 (http://app.com)',
];
$client = new phpSmug\Client("[YOUR_API_KEY]", $options));
$albums = $client->get('user/[your_username]!albums');
```

From the `$client` object, you can access to all the SmugMug 2.0 API methods.

## Documentation

See the [`docs` directory](docs/) or http://phpsmug.com/docs/ for more detailed documentation.

## Examples

phpSmug comes with 3 examples to help get you on your way. All 3 examples perform the same thing, just using differing authentication methods. They all show thumbnails of the first album found for the respective authentication methods:

- `example.php` illustrates anonymous, unauthenticated access.
- `example-oauth.php` illustrates an OAuth login.
- `example-external-links.php` illustrates displaying private images.

## Getting Help

The best way to get help with implementing phpSmug into your projects is to open an [issue](https://github.com/lildude/phpSmug/issues).  This allows you to easily search for other issues where others may have asked to the same questions or hit the same problems and if they haven't, your issue will add to the resources available to others at a later date.
